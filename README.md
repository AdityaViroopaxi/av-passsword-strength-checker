Password Strength Checker Project Overview

1. Project Purpose
The password strength checker validates the quality of passwords, helping users or applications determine how strong or weak a password is based on specific criteria. It provides feedback on missing requirements and a strength rating so users can create safer passwords.

2. Core Logic Explained
The main algorithm evaluates passwords according to these criteria:

Length Check:
Is the password at least 8 characters?
Longer passwords generally increase security against brute-force attacks.

Lowercase Letters:
Does it have at least one lowercase letter [a-z]?
Ensures character variety.

Uppercase Letters:
Does it have at least one uppercase letter [A-Z]?
Adds complexity, making dictionary attacks harder.

Numbers:
Does it include digits [0-9]?
Numeric inclusion diversifies characters again.

Special Characters:
Checks for symbols like !@#$%^&*() etc.
Special characters greatly increase variant combinations.

For each satisfied criterion, the score increments by 1, up to a maximum of 5. The sum score maps to a strength level:

Score      Strength
0â€“2        WEAK
3          OKAY
4          GOOD
5          STRONG

Additionally, feedback messages help the user know exactly what to improve, e.g., "Add uppercase letters", "Add special characters", etc.

3. Node.js Libraries Used and Why

a) Built-in Libraries

- readline (Node.js Built-in Module)
  Used in the CLI interface (src/cli.js) to read input from the user interactively in the command line. It allows prompting the user to enter passwords and react immediately.

- process (Node.js Global Object)
  Used to access command-line arguments (process.argv) to accept password input directly from the command line.

b) External Libraries

- Jest (Development Dependency)
  Used for writing and running unit tests to ensure the password checker works correctly across different inputs and edge cases. It provides a reliable test runner and assertion framework.

4. Project Structure and Why

- src/index.js
  Contains the core password checking logic, isolated from UI or CLI, so it can be reused as a library.

- src/cli.js
  Command-line interface script utilizing readline to interact with users, accept passwords, and print feedback. It makes the package useful as a practical standalone tool.

- test/index.test.js
  Contains automated Jest tests checking the correctness of the password checker function for various cases (weak, strong, empty passwords).

- package.json
  Metadata, dependency management, and scripts configuration to run tests and publish the package.

5. How It Works Together

- When executed via CLI, the program prompts or accepts the password input.
- The password is passed to the core checkPassword function.
- The function returns a detailed result with score, strength text, and feedback messages.
- CLI displays this information in a user-friendly format.
- Developers can import checkPassword in their Node.js projects or front-end via bundlers to integrate password validation without CLI.

6. Why These Choices Were Made

- Using simple regex tests for password checks keeps it fast, lightweight, and free of dependencies.
- Using Node.js built-ins like readline and process avoids extra dependencies and leverages native functionality for CLI interaction.
- Testing with Jest ensures confidence and maintainability.
- Modular code aligns with best practices by separating core logic and CLI interface for reuse and easier testing.

7. Security Considerations

- The checker evaluates structure and character diversity; it does not check against breached password databases.
- Use this tool as one layer among others (e.g., rate limiting, hashing, breach databases) to build secure authentication.
- The logic can be extended with custom rules or external checks to strengthen security.

8. What You Can Do Next

- Add more sophisticated checks (e.g., entropy calculation, dictionary word detection)
- Add integration into web forms or APIs
- Build UI feedback components for real-time validation in front-end apps
- Automate publishing and testing with CI/CD pipelines to streamline the development lifecycle
